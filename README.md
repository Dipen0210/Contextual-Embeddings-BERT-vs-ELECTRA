\section{Project Overview}
This project explores the concept of contextual word embeddings, comparing how different models (ELECTRA and BERT) perform in generating word embeddings, particularly focusing on their ability to disambiguate words based on context. The project implements and evaluates the effectiveness of contextual embeddings generated by the ELECTRA model, comparing them against BERTâ€™s embeddings. Additionally, performance metrics such as speed and efficiency are examined for both models.

\section{Project Structure}
This project is divided into two main parts:

\subsection{Part 1: Contextual Word Embedding with Same Word, Different Meaning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective}: Visualize how the meaning of the same word changes based on context. The example used is the word \textit{bank}, which has different meanings in two sentences.
    \item \textbf{Methodology}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Load the ELECTRA model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
        \item Tokenize input sentences and generate embeddings.
        \item Perform dimensionality reduction using t-SNE to visualize embeddings.
        \item Compare token embeddings in the two contexts of the word \textit{bank}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Part 2: Paragraph Testing - BERT vs. ELECTRA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective}: Compare the speed and effectiveness of BERT and ELECTRA models in generating contextual embeddings for a paragraph.
    \item \textbf{Methodology}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Load both the BERT-base and ELECTRA-small models.
        \item Run both models on GPU.
        \item Measure and compare the time taken to generate embeddings for the same input paragraph.
        \item Visualize the embeddings using t-SNE for comparison.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Getting Started}

\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python 3.x
    \item PyTorch
    \item Transformers library by Hugging Face
    \item Matplotlib (for visualization)
    \item NumPy (for handling array operations)
    \item t-SNE (for dimensionality reduction)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clone the repository:
    \begin{verbatim}
    git clone <repository-url>
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Install the necessary dependencies:
    \begin{verbatim}
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    \end{verbatim}
    \item Download the pretrained models from Hugging Face:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{ELECTRA-small}
        \item \texttt{BERT-base}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Running the Project}

\subsection{Part 1: Contextual Word Embeddings}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run the \texttt{contextual\_word\_embeddings.py} script.
    \item Input two sentences for analysis. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``The bank will not approve the loan.''
        \item ``He sat on the bank of the river.''
    \end{itemize}
    \item The script will generate embeddings for both sentences, apply t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, and visualize the embeddings in 2D.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Part 2: BERT vs ELECTRA Comparison}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run the \texttt{bert\_vs\_electra\_comparison.py} script.
    \item Input a paragraph for embedding generation (e.g., any general paragraph).
    \item The script will output the time taken by both models and generate t-SNE visualizations comparing the embeddings.
\end{itemize}

\section{Example Input and Output}

\subsection{Part 1: Contextual Word Embedding}
\textbf{Input Sentences:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``The bank will not approve the loan.''
    \item ``He sat on the bank of the river.''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Visualization:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The plot will display two distinct clusters for the word \textit{bank}, one indicating its financial meaning and the other indicating its geographical meaning as a riverbank.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Part 2: BERT vs ELECTRA Comparison}
\textbf{Input Paragraph:} (Example of any general paragraph)

\textbf{Output Timing:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item BERT-Base Time: 1.4768 seconds
    \item ELECTRA-Small Time: 0.2584 seconds
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ELECTRA is faster than BERT in generating embeddings due to its more efficient architecture.
    \item Both models produce well-structured embeddings, but ELECTRA is significantly faster.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Part 1: Contextual Word Embeddings}
\textbf{Observations:} The embeddings clearly separate the word ``bank'' in two different contexts: as a financial institution and as a riverbank.

\textbf{Visualization:} The t-SNE plot demonstrates how effectively the model differentiates between different meanings of the same word based on the context.

\subsection{Part 2: BERT vs ELECTRA Comparison}
\textbf{Observations:} ELECTRA outperforms BERT in terms of speed, completing the embedding generation task much faster.

\textbf{Visualization:} The embeddings generated by both models are visually similar but show that ELECTRA can generate comparable embeddings at a much faster rate.

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Key Findings:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ELECTRA provides high-quality contextual embeddings in a much shorter processing time compared to BERT.
        \item Both models are effective in distinguishing word meanings based on context, but ELECTRA is particularly suited for real-time applications where speed is crucial.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Future Work:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Further research is needed to explore ELECTRA's performance in multilingual tasks.
        \item Future studies will apply these models to sentiment analysis of financial news to assess their applicability in real-world applications.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
